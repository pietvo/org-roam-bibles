 A Song of Ascents.
1. Blessed is everyone who fears the LORD, who walks in his ways.
2. For you will eat the labour of your hands. You will be happy, and it will be well with you.
3. Your wife will be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house, your children like olive shoots around your table.
4. Behold, this is how the man who fears the LORD is blessed.
5. May the LORD bless you out of Zion, and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
6. Yes, may you see your childrenâ€™s children. Peace be upon Israel.
