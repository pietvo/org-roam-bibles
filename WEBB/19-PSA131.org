 A Song of Ascents. By David.
1. LORD, my heart isnâ€™t arrogant, nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters, or things too wonderful for me.
2. Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.
3. Israel, hope in the LORD, from this time forward and forever more.
