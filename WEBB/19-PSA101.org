 A Psalm by David.
1. I will sing of loving kindness and justice. To you, LORD, I will sing praises.
2. I will be careful to live a blameless life. When will you come to me? I will walk within my house with a blameless heart.
3. I will set no vile thing before my eyes. I hate the deeds of faithless men. They will not cling to me.
4. A perverse heart will be far from me. I will have nothing to do with evil.
5. I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbour. I won’t tolerate one who is arrogant and conceited.
6. My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me. He who walks in a perfect way, he will serve me.
7. He who practices deceit won’t dwell within my house. He who speaks falsehood won’t be established before my eyes.
8. Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land, to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the LORD’s city.
