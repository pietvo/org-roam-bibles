# World English Bible (WEB) - U.S. spelling

Derived from the USFX version of the WEB, downloaded on Dec. 8, 2020 from
https://ebible.org/Scriptures/engwebp_usfx.zip.

1. Download engwebp_usfx.zip to the current directory

2. Extract `engwebp_usfx.xml` from the zip file.

3. run `python3 makeorg.py engwebp_usfx.xml`\
(needs Python 3.9 or later)

4. Move the generated `*.org` files to your `org-roam` directory.

NOTE: I have made two manual corrections after step 3:\
a) In 2 Chronicles 3:15 (14-2CH03.org), the word 'heigh' was replaced by 'high'.\
b) In Zephaniah 1:17 (file 36-ZEP01.org), a full stop (.) was added between 'Yahweh' and 'Their'
