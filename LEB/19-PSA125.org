:END:

1. Those who trust in Yahweh are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever.
2. As mountains are round about Jerusalem, so Yahweh is round about his people, from now until forever.
3. For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the ⌞land⌟ of the righteous, lest the righteous stretch out their hands to do wickedness.
4. Do good, O Yahweh, to the good, and to those upright in their hearts.
5. But regarding those who turn aside to their crooked ways, Yahweh will lead them away with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel.
