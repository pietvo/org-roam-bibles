1. “ ‘On that day a well will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, ⌞to cleanse them from sin and from impurity⌟.
2. ⌞And then⌟, on that day,’ ⌞declares⌟ Yahweh of hosts, ‘I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and also the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness I will banish from the land.
3. ⌞And then⌟, if anyone prophesies again, his father and his mother who bore him will say to him, “You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of Yahweh!” And his father and his mother who bore him will pierce him through when he prophesies.
4. ⌞And then⌟ on that day, each of the prophets will be ashamed because of his vision when he was prophesying, and they will not put on a cloak of hair in order to deceive,
5. but he will say, “I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the soil, for a man has acquired me since my youth.”
6. And someone shall say to him, “What are these wounds ⌞between your arms⌟?” and he will say, “Those I have received in the house of the ones who love me.” ’ ”
7. “O sword, awake against my shepherd, against the man who is my associate,” ⌞declares⌟ Yahweh of hosts. “Strike the shepherd, so that the sheep may be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the small ones.
8. ⌞And then⌟ in all the land,” ⌞declares⌟ Yahweh, “⌞two thirds⌟ will be cut off and perish, and one third will be left alive in it.
9. And I will bring the remaining third into the fire, and I will refine them like one refines silver, and I will test them like one tests gold. They will call my name, and I will answer them. I will say, ‘They are my people,’ and they will say, ‘Yahweh is my God.’ ”
