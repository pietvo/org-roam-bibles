* Psalms 126 (LEB)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: LEB/19-PSA126
:END:

1. When Yahweh restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers.
2. Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with rejoicing. Then they said among the nations, “Yahweh has done great things for these people.”
3. Yahweh has done great things for us; we are glad.
4. Restore, O Yahweh, our fortunes like the streams in the Negeb.
5. Those who sow with tears shall reap with rejoicing.
6. He who diligently goes out with weeping, carrying the seed bag, shall certainly come in with rejoicing, carrying his sheaves.
