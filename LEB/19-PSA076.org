1. A psalm of Asaph. A song. God is known in Judah. His name is great in Israel.
2. His den has been in Salem, his lair in Zion.
3. There he broke the flames of the bow, the shield and sword and battle. Selah
4. Radiant you are, majestic, from the mountains of prey.
5. The stouthearted are plundered; they sleep their sleep, and all the able men cannot ⌞use⌟ their hands.
6. At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse slumber.
7. ⌞You, indeed, are to be feared⌟, and who can stand before you when you are angry?
8. From heaven you proclaimed judgment. The earth feared and was still
9. when God rose for justice, to save all the afflicted of the land. Selah
10. For the anger of humankind will praise you. You will put on the remnant of anger.
11. Make vows and fulfill them to Yahweh, your God; let all surrounding him bring tribute to the one to be feared.
12. He cuts off the spirit of leaders. He is to be feared by the kings of the earth.
