1. “My spirit is pulled down; my days are extinguished; the graveyard is for me.
2. ⌞Surely⌟ mockery is with me, and my eye ⌞rests⌟ on their provocation.
3. Please lay down a pledge for me with yourself; who is he who will give security for my hand?
4. Indeed, you have closed their mind from understanding; therefore, you will not let them triumph.
5. He denounces friends for reward, so his children’s eyes will fail.
6. “And he has made me a proverb for the peoples, ⌞and I am one before whom people spit⌟.
7. And my eye has grown dim from grief, and the limbs of my body are all like a shadow.
8. The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent excites himself over the godless.
9. But the righteous holds on to his way, and ⌞he who has clean hands⌟ increases in strength.
10. But ⌞all of you must return⌟—⌞please come⌟! But I shall not find a wise person among you.
11. “My days are past; my plans are broken down— even the desires of my heart.
12. They make night into day, saying, ‘Light is ⌞near to darkness⌟.’
13. If I hope for Sheol as my house, if I spread my couch in the darkness,
14. if I call to the pit, ‘You are my father,’ to the maggot, ‘You are my mother or my sister,’
15. where then is my hope? And ⌞who will see my hope⌟?
16. Will they go down to the bars of Sheol? Or shall we descend together into the dust?”
