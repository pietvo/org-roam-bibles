* Psalms 64 (LEB)

:END:

1. Hear my voice, O God, in my lamenting. Preserve my life from the fear of the enemy.
2. Hide me from the secret plots of evildoers, from the unrest of those who do iniquity,
3. who sharpen their tongue like a sword. They bend their bow to shoot their arrows—bitter words,
4. to shoot from their hiding places at the blameless. Suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear.
5. They encourage themselves in the evil matter. They talk of secretly laying snares. They say, “Who will see them?”
6. ⌞They carefully plot⌟ injustices saying, “We have perfected ⌞the perfect plot⌟!” Both the ⌞inner thought⌟ and heart of a man are deep.
7. But God will shoot them; with an arrow they will suddenly be wounded.
8. And they who would cause him to stumble, their own tongue will be against them. All who gaze on them will shake.
9. And then all men will fear, and will declare the working of God, and will understand his doing.
10. The righteous will rejoice in Yahweh and take refuge in him, and all the upright in heart will boast.
