1. His foundation is on the holy mountains.
2. Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
3. Glorious things are spoken about you, O city of God. Selah
4. I will record those who know me in Rahab and Babylon, behold in Philistia and Tyre with Cush, “This one was born there.”
5. But with respect to Zion it shall be said, “⌞Each one⌟ was born in her,” for the Most High himself will establish her.
6. Yahweh will record in writing the peoples, “This one was born there.” Selah
7. And while dancing, singers will sing, “All my springs are in you.”
