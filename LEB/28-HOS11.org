* Hosea 11 (LEB)

:END:

1. When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.
2. When I called them, they went from my face. They sacrificed to the Baals, and they sacrificed to idols.
3. And I myself taught Ephraim to walk; I took them in my arms, but they did not know that I healed them.
4. I drew them ⌞with human ties⌟, with the bands of love. I was to them like one who lifted up a yoke on their jaws, though I bent down to them and let them eat.
5. He will return to the land of Egypt, and Assyria will be his king, because they refused to return.
6. The sword rages in his cities; it consumes his false prophets and devours because of their plans.
7. My people are bent on backsliding from me. To the Most High they call, he does not raise them at all.
8. How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is disturbed within me; ⌞all⌟ my compassions are aroused.
9. ⌞I will not execute⌟ ⌞my fierce anger⌟, I will not again destroy Ephraim; because I am God and not a mortal, the Holy One in your midst; and I will not come in wrath.
10. They will go after Yahweh; he roars like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the sea.
11. They will tremble like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria; and I will let them return to their homes— a declaration of Yahweh.
12. Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; and Judah is still wandering with God and is faithful to the Holy One.
