1. Out of the depths I call to you, O Yahweh.
2. “O Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
3. If you, O Yah, should ⌞keep track of⌟ iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
4. But with you is forgiveness, so that you may be feared.”
5. I await Yahweh; my soul awaits, and I wait for his word.
6. My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning. Yes, more than watchmen for the morning.
7. O Israel, wait for Yahweh. For with Yahweh there is loyal love, and with him there is abundant redemption.
8. And he will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.
