* Psalms 36 (LEB)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: LEB/19-PSA036
:END:

1. An oracle: the wicked has rebellion in the midst of his heart. There is no fear of God before his eyes.
2. For he flatters himself in his eyes, hating to detect his iniquity.
3. The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit. He has ceased to have insight and to do good.
4. He plans sin on his bed. He puts himself on a way that is not good. He does not reject evil.
5. O Yahweh, your loyal love extends into the heavens, your faithfulness unto the clouds.
6. Your righteousness is ⌞like the mighty mountains⌟, your judgments like the great deep. You save man and beast, O Yahweh.
7. How precious is your loyal love, O God, and the children of humankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
8. They are refreshed with the ⌞fullness⌟ of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.
9. For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.
10. Prolong your loyal love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright of heart.
11. Do not let a foot of pride come against me, nor let a wicked hand make me to wander homeless.
12. There doers of evil have fallen; they are thrust down and not able to rise.
