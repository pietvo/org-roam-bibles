:END:

1. To you, O Yahweh, I call. O my rock, do not be deaf to me. Or else, if you are silent to me, then I will become like those descending to the pit.
2. Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to you for help, when I lift up my hands toward your holy inner sanctuary.
3. Do not drag me away with the wicked or with the workers of evil, who speak of peace with their neighbors, while evil is in their heart.
4. Give to them according to their work, even according to the evil of their deeds. Give to them according to the work of their hands; repay them their rightful due.
5. Because they do not regard the works of Yahweh, nor the work of his hands, he will destroy them and not rebuild them.
6. Blessed is Yahweh, because he has heard the voice of my supplications.
7. Yahweh is my strength and my shield. My heart trusts him and I am helped. So my heart rejoices, and with my song I will give thanks to him.
8. Yahweh is their strength, and he is the refuge for the salvation of his anointed one.
9. Save your people and bless your heritage. Shepherd them also and carry them always.
