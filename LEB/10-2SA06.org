1. David again gathered all the chosen men in Israel, thirty thousand.
2. David got up and went and all the people who were with him, from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God which is called the name, the name of Yahweh of hosts, ⌞upon which the cherubim sit⌟.
3. They loaded the ark of God on a new utility cart, and they carried it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Now Uzza and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new utility cart along.
4. So they brought it out from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill with the ark of God, and Ahio was going before the ark.
5. Now David and all the house of Israel were dancing before Yahweh, with all kinds of musical instruments made from ash trees, and with zithers, harps, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.
6. When they came to the threshing floor of Nakon, Uzza reached out to the ark of God and took hold of it, because the oxen had stumbled.
7. ⌞Then the anger of Yahweh was kindled⌟ against Uzza, and God struck him down there because of the indiscretion, and he died there beside the ark of God.
8. ⌞David was angry⌟ because Yahweh had burst out against Uzza, and he called that place Perez-Uzza until this day.
9. But David feared Yahweh on that day and said, “How can the ark of Yahweh come to me?”
10. However, David was not willing to bring the ark of Yahweh to himself, to the city of David, so David caused it to turn to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
11. So the ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom and all his household.
12. It was told to King David, “Yahweh has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and all that is his because of the ark of God.” So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the city of David with jubilation.
13. It happened that when the carriers of the ark of Yahweh had marched six steps that he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.
14. Now David was dancing with all his might before Yahweh, and David was wearing a linen ephod.
15. So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of Yahweh with shouts of joyful acclaim and with the sound of the trumpet.
16. It happened that when the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked down through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before Yahweh, and she despised him in her heart.
17. They brought the ark of Yahweh and set it in its place in the middle of the tent which David had pitched for it. Then David offered up burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in the presence of Yahweh.
18. When David had finished from the sacrificing of the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of hosts.
19. Then he distributed to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, from man to woman, to each: one ring-shaped piece of bread, one cake of dates, and one cake of raisins; and all the people went each to his house.
20. When David returned to bless his household, Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David. She said, “How the king of Israel honored himself today ⌞by uncovering himself⌟ before the eyes of the maids of his servants, ⌞as the total exposure of a worthless one⌟.”
21. So David said to Michal, “In the presence of Yahweh who chose me ⌞over⌟ your father and ⌞over⌟ his household, to appoint me as leader over the people of Yahweh, over Israel, I have celebrated before Yahweh.
22. I will demean myself again more than this, and I will be abased in my eyes, but with the maids whom you mentioned, with them I will be honored.”
23. So for Michal the daughter of Saul, she had no child until the day of her death.
