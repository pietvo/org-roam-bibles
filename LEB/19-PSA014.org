* Psalms 14 (LEB)
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

1. The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt. They do abominable deeds. There is none who does good.
2. Yahweh looks down from heaven upon the children of humankind to see whether there is one who has insight, one who cares about God.
3. All have gone astray; they are altogether corrupt. There is not one who does good; there is not even one.
4. All who do evil—do they not know, they who eat my people as though they were eating bread? They do not call on Yahweh.
5. There ⌞they are very fearful⌟ because God is with the generation of the righteous.
6. You would put to shame the plan of the poor, because Yahweh is his refuge.
7. ⌞Oh that from Zion⌟ would come salvation for Israel! When Yahweh returns the fortunes of his people, Jacob will rejoice; Israel will be happy.
