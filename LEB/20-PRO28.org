2. By the rebellion of a land, her rulers increase, but by a person of intelligence who knows justice, it will last.
3. A man who is poor and oppresses the impoverished is a beating rain ⌞that leaves⌟ no food.
4. Those who forsake instruction will praise the wicked, but they who guard instruction will struggle against them.
5. Men of evil do not understand justice, but seekers of Yahweh understand completely.
6. Better to be poor and walking in one’s integrity than to be crooked of ways when one is rich.
7. He who keeps instruction is a child of understanding, but the companion of gluttons will shame his father.
8. He who augments his wealth with interest and with usury gathers it for him who is kind to the poor.
9. He who turns his ear from listening to instruction, even his prayer is an abomination.
10. He who misleads the upright onto the way of evil, into his pits he will fall. But as for the blameless, they will inherit good.
11. A man of wealth is wise in his own eyes, but the intelligent poor sees through him.
12. When the righteous triumphs, great is the glory, but with the rising of the wicked, a person will be hidden.
13. He who conceals his transgression will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes will obtain mercy.

15. Like a roaring lion and a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a poor people.

23. He who rebukes a person will afterward find more favor than he who flatters with the tongue.
24. He who robs his father and his mother and says, “There is no crime,” is partner to a man who corrupts.
