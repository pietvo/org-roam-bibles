* Psalms 114 (LEB)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: LEB/19-PSA114
:END:

1. When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of a strange language,
2. Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
3. The sea looked and fled; the Jordan turned back.
4. The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like ⌞lambs⌟.
5. What’s with you, O sea, that you fled? O Jordan, that you turned back?
6. O mountains, that you skipped like rams? O hills, like lambs?
7. At the presence of the Lord writhe, O earth, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
8. who turned the rock into a pool of water, flinty stone into a spring of water.
