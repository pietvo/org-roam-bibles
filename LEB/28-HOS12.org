:END:

1. Ephraim herds the wind and is pursuing the east wind all day long; he multiplies deception and violence and he ⌞makes a treaty with Assyria⌟, and oil is brought to Egypt.
2. Yahweh has a quarrel with Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds.
3. In the womb he deceived his brother, and in his manhood he struggled with God.
4. He struggled with the angel and prevailed; he pleaded for his mercy. He met him at Bethel, and there he spoke with him.
5. Yahweh the God of hosts, Yahweh is his renowned name!
6. But you, you must return to your God; keep love and justice, and wait continually for your God.
7. The trader, in his hand are scales of deceit; he loves to oppress.
8. And Ephraim said, “Surely, I am rich, I gained wealth for myself; in all my toil they have not found guilt in me that is sin.
9. But I am Yahweh your God since the land of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, like the days of the appointed festival.
10. I spoke to the prophets; I myself multiplied revelations and through the hand of the prophets I will destroy.
11. If in Gilead there is evil, surely they will come to nothing. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, also their altars will be like stone heaps on furrows of the field.
12. Jacob fled to the open field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he watched over sheep.
13. And by a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up from Egypt, and by a prophet he was watched over.
14. Ephraim has caused bitter provocation, and his Lord will ⌞hold him responsible for his crimes⌟ and pay back to him his insults.
