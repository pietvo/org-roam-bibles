1. Praise Yah! Praise, O servants of Yahweh, praise the name of Yahweh.
2. Let the name of Yahweh be blessed, from now until forever.
3. From the rising of the sun to its setting, let the name of Yahweh be blessed.
4. Yahweh is high above all nations; his glory is above the heavens.
5. Who is like Yahweh our God, who is enthroned on high,
6. who ⌞condescends to look at⌟ what is in the heavens and in the earth?
7. He raises the helpless from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap,
8. to seat them with princes, with the princes of his people.
9. He causes the barren woman of the house to dwell as the happy mother of children. Praise Yah!
