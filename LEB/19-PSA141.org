* Psalms 141 (LEB)

:END:

1. I call on you, O Yahweh; hasten to me. Listen to my voice when I call to you.
2. Let my prayer be set before you as incense, the lifting up of my palms as the evening offering.
3. Set a guard, O Yahweh, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips.
4. Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked deeds with men who do iniquity; and do not let me eat of their delicacies.
5. Let a righteous one strike me in kindness, and let him chasten me. It is oil for my head; let not my head refuse. For still my prayer is against their evil deeds.
6. When their judges are thrown down the sides of a cliff, then they will understand that my words were pleasant.
7. As when one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
8. But my eyes are toward you, O Yahweh, my Lord; I have taken refuge in you. Do not lay bare my soul.
9. Protect me from the ⌞grasp⌟ of the trap they have laid for me, and from the snares of evildoers.
10. Let the wicked fall into their nets, while I escape altogether.
