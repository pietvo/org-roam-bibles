:ID: LEB/23-ISA11
:END:

1. And a shoot will come out from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from its roots will bear fruit.
2. And the spirit of Yahweh shall rest on him— a spirit of wisdom and understanding, a spirit of counsel and might, a spirit of knowledge and the fear of Yahweh.
3. And his ⌞breath⌟ is in the fear of Yahweh. And he shall judge not by his eyesight, and he shall rebuke not by ⌞what he hears with⌟ his ears.
4. But he shall judge the poor with righteousness, and he shall decide for the needy of the earth with rectitude. And he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and he shall kill the wicked person with the breath of his lips.
5. And righteousness shall be the belt around his waist, and faithfulness the belt around his loins.
6. And a wolf shall ⌞stay⌟ with a lamb, and a leopard shall lie down with a kid, and a calf and a lion and a fatling together ⌞as a small boy leads⌟ them.
7. And a cow and a bear shall graze; their young shall lie down together. And a lion shall eat straw like the cattle.
8. And ⌞an infant⌟ shall play over a serpent’s hole, and ⌞a toddler⌟ shall put his hand on a viper’s hole.
9. They will not injure and they will not destroy on all of my ⌞holy mountain⌟, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea.
10. And this shall happen on that day: the nations shall inquire of the root of Jesse, which shall be standing as a signal to the peoples, and his resting place shall be glorious.
11. And this shall happen on that day: The Lord will again extend his hand a second time to acquire the remnant of his people that is left, from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the coastlands of the sea,
12. and he will raise a signal for the nations. And he will gather the outcasts of Israel, and he will gather the scattered ones of Judah together from the four ⌞corners⌟ of the earth.
13. And the jealousy of Ephraim shall depart, and the enemies of Judah shall be cut off. Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah, and Judah shall not be an enemy of Ephraim.
14. But they shall ⌞swoop⌟ upon the Philistine shoulder, ⌞westward⌟. Together they shall plunder the sons of the east. Edom and Moab ⌞will be under their command⌟, and the sons of Ammon will be their subjugated people.
15. And Yahweh will divide the tongue of the sea of Egypt, and he will wave his hand over the river with his scorching wind; and he will strike it into seven streams, and he will ⌞make it passable by foot⌟.
16. So there shall be a highway from Assyria for the remnant of his people that remains, as there was for Israel ⌞when⌟ it went up from the land of Egypt.
