1. Although God spoke long ago in many parts and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets,
2. in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the world,
3. who is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, sustaining all things by the word of power. When he had made purification for sins through him, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
4. having become by so much better than the angels, by as much as he has inherited a more excellent name than theirs.
5. For to which of the angels did he ever say, “You are my son, today I have begotten you,” and again, “I will be ⌞his father⌟, and he will be ⌞my son⌟”?
6. And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, “And let all the angels of God worship him.”
7. And concerning the angels he says, “The one who makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire,”
8. but concerning the Son, “Your throne, O God, is ⌞forever and ever⌟, and the scepter of righteous is the scepter of your kingdom.
9. You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; because of this God, your God, has anointed you with the olive oil of joy more than your companions.
10. And, “You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the works of your hands;
11. they will perish, but you continue, and they will all become old like a garment,
12. and like a robe you will roll them up, and like a garment they will be changed; but you are the same, and your years will not run out.”
13. But to which of the angels has he ever said, “Sit down at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”
14. Are they not all spirits engaged in special service, sent on assignment for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation?
