* Psalms 123 (LEB)

:END:

1. I lift up my eyes to you, the one enthroned in the heavens.
2. Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to Yahweh our God, until he is gracious to us.
3. Be gracious to us, O Yahweh, be gracious to us, for long enough we have had our fill of contempt.
4. For long enough our soul has had its fill of the derision of the self-confident, the contempt of the arrogant.
