* Psalms 6 (LEB)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: LEB/19-PSA006
:END:

1. A psalm of David. O Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger, and do not discipline me in your wrath.
2. Be gracious to me, O Yahweh, because I am feeble. Heal me, O Yahweh, for my bones are terrified.
3. My soul is also very terrified. But you, O Yahweh, how long?
4. Turn, O Yahweh; deliver my life. Save me for the sake of your steadfast love.
5. For there is no remembrance of you in death. In Sheol, who will give thanks to you?
6. I am weary with my groaning; ⌞I flood⌟ my bed every night. With my tears ⌞I drench⌟ my couch.
7. My eye wastes away because of vexation; it grows old because of all my oppressors.
8. Depart from me, all workers of evil, for Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping.
9. Yahweh has heard my plea; Yahweh has accepted my prayer.
10. All my enemies shall be ashamed and shall be very terrified. They shall turn back; they shall suddenly be ashamed.
