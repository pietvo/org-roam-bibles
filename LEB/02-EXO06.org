1. And Yahweh said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, because with a strong hand he will release them, and with a strong hand he will drive them out from his land.”
2. And God spoke to Moses, and he said to him, “I am Yahweh.
3. And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Shaddai, but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them.
4. And I not only established my covenant with them to give to them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, in which they dwelt as aliens,
5. but also I myself heard the groaning of the ⌞Israelites⌟, whom the Egyptians are making to work, and I remembered my covenant.
6. Therefore say to the ⌞Israelites⌟, ‘I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the ⌞forced labor⌟ of Egypt, and I will deliver you from their slavery, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great punishments.
7. And I will take you ⌞as my people⌟, and I will be ⌞your God⌟, and you will know that I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from under the ⌞forced labor⌟ of Egypt.
8. And I will bring you to the land ⌞that I swore⌟ to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it to you as a possession. I am Yahweh.”
9. And Moses spoke thus to the ⌞Israelites⌟, but they did not listen to Moses, because of ⌞discouragement⌟ and because of hard work.
10. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
11. “Go, speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and let him release the ⌞Israelites⌟ from his land.”
12. And Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, “Look, the ⌞Israelites⌟ do not listen to me, and how will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am ⌞a poor speaker⌟?”
13. And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and he commanded them to go to the ⌞Israelites⌟ and to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to bring the ⌞Israelites⌟ out from the land of Egypt.

25. And Eleazar the son of Aaron took for himself one from the daughters of Putiel as a wife, and she bore for him Phinehas. These are the heads of the ⌞families⌟ of the Levites according to their clans.
26. It was that Aaron and Moses to whom Yahweh said, “Bring the ⌞Israelites⌟ out from the land of Egypt according to their divisions.”
27. They were those who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, in order to bring the ⌞Israelites⌟ out from Egypt. It was that Moses and Aaron.
28. ⌞And so it was on a certain day⌟ Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt.
29. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, “I am Yahweh. Speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, all that I am speaking to you.”
30. And Moses said before Yahweh, “Look, I am ⌞a poor speaker⌟. And how will Pharaoh listen to me?”
