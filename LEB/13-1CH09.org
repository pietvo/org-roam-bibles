1. So all Israel was enrolled in genealogy. And behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel. And Judah was taken away to Babylon on account of their sin.
2. Now the first inhabitants who were settled on their property in their cities in Israel were the priests, the Levites, and the temple servants.
3. And some of the people of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh lived in Jerusalem:
4. Uthai the son of Ammihud, son of Omri, son of Imri, son of Bani, from the sons of Perez, the son of Judah.
5. And from the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn and his sons.

8. Ibneah the son of Jeroham; Elah the son of Uzzi, son of Michri; Meshullam the son of Shephatiah, son of Reuel, son of Ibnijah;
9. and their brethren according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty-six. All these men were the heads of the ⌞families⌟ in the house of their fathers.

17. And the gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brethren (Shallum was the chief);
18. until then they were gatekeepers at the gate of the king on the east side toward the camps of the Levites.
19. And Shallum the son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his kinsmen of the house of his fathers, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, the guardians of the entrances to the tent, and their fathers were over the camp of Yahweh, guardians of the entrance.
20. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the leader over them ⌞in time past⌟; Yahweh was with him.
21. Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the doorway to the tent of assembly.
22. All of them were chosen as gatekeepers at the entrances, two hundred and twelve. They were enrolled by genealogies in their villages. They were established by David and Samuel the seer on account of their faithfulness.
23. So they and their sons were over the gates of the house of Yahweh at the house of the tent as guards.
24. The gatekeepers were on four sides: east, west, north, and south.
25. And their brethren in their villages were to come every seven days ⌞by turn⌟ to be with these.
26. For the four mighty gatekeepers, they who were Levites, ⌞were entrusted⌟ and were over the chambers and over the storerooms of the house of God.
27. And they lodged all around the house of God, for upon them was a responsibility. And ⌞they had charge of opening the house of God every morning⌟.
28. And some of them were over the utensils of the service, for ⌞they count them⌟ when they are brought in and ⌞they count them⌟ when they are brought out.
29. And some of them were appointed over the objects, over the objects of the sanctuary, and over the wheat flour and the wine, the olive oil, the frankincense, and the spices.
30. And some of the sons of the priests mixed the fragrant ointment for the spices.
31. And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite and ⌞was entrusted⌟ with the work of the pan breads.
32. And from the sons of the Kohathites, some of their kinsmen were over the ⌞showbread⌟ to prepare it ⌞every Sabbath⌟.
33. Now these were the singers; the heads of the ⌞families⌟ of the Levites were in the chambers free from other service, for day and night they were over them on the service.
34. These were the heads of the ⌞families⌟ of the Levites according to their genealogies, leaders. These lived in Jerusalem.
35. And these lived in Gibeon: Jeiel the father of Gibeon. And the name of his wife was Maacah.
