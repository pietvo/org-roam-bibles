* Psalms 142 (LEB)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: LEB/19-PSA142
:END:

1. When he was in the cave. A prayer. I cry out with my voice to Yahweh; I implore favor with my voice to Yahweh.
2. I pour out my complaint before him; I declare my trouble before him.
3. When my spirit faints within me, you know my way. On the path where I walk, they have hidden a trap for me;
4. look to my right and see. There is no one looking out for me; there is no escape for me; no one cares for my soul.
5. I cry out to you, O Yahweh. I say, “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.”
6. Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low. Deliver me from my pursuers, for they are stronger than I.
7. Bring me out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will encircle me, because you will deal bountifully with me.
