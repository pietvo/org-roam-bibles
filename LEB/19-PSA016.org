1. Protect me, O God, for I take refuge in you.
2. Oh my soul you have said to Yahweh, “You are my Lord. I have no good apart from you.”
3. With regard to the saints who are in the land, they are the noble ones in whom is all my desire.
4. Those who hurry after another god increase their sorrows. I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood, nor take up their names on my lips.
5. Yahweh is the portion which is my share and my cup. You hold my lot.
6. The measuring lines have fallen for me in pleasant places. Yes, my inheritance is delightful for me.
7. I will bless Yahweh who advises me; yes, at night my ⌞innermost being⌟ instructs me.
8. I have set Yahweh before me always. Because he is at my right hand I will not be shaken.
9. Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices. Yes, my body will dwell in safety,
10. for you will not abandon my soul to Sheol; you will not give your faithful one to see the grave.
11. You will make known to me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. At your right hand are pleasures forever.
