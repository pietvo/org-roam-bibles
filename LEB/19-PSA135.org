:END:

1. Praise Yah! Praise the name of Yahweh. Praise him, O servants of Yahweh,
2. who stand in the house of Yahweh, in the courts of the house of our God.
3. Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good. Sing praises concerning his name, for it is pleasant.
4. For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel as his special possession.
5. For I know that Yahweh is great, and our Lord is greater than all gods.
6. All that Yahweh desires, he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the depths.
7. He causes clouds to rise from the edge of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain; he brings out the wind from his storehouses.
8. Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of humans and animals.
9. He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.
10. Who struck many nations and killed mighty kings—
11. Sihon the king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan—
12. and he gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance for his people Israel.
13. O Yahweh, your name endures forever, your ⌞renown⌟ ⌞throughout all generations⌟,
14. for Yahweh will plead the cause of his people and will have compassion on his servants.
15. The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of the hands of humankind.
16. They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see;
17. they have ears, but cannot hear; there is not even breath in their mouths.
18. Those who make them become like them, as does everyone who trusts in them.
19. O house of Israel, bless Yahweh. O house of Aaron, bless Yahweh.
20. O house of Levi, bless Yahweh. You who fear Yahweh, bless Yahweh.
21. Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise Yah!
