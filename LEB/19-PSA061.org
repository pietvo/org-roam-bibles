1. Hear, O God, my cry; attend to my prayer.
2. From the end of the earth I call to you when my heart grows faint. You will lead me to a rock that is higher than I.
3. For you have been my refuge, a strong tower from the enemy.
4. Let me reside in your tent forever. Let me take refuge under the covering of your wings. Selah
5. For you, O God, you have heard my vows. You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
6. You will add days to the days of the king, his years like those of ⌞many generations⌟.
7. May he live forever in the presence of God. Appoint loyal love and faithfulness to preserve him.
8. So I will sing the praise of your name forever, that I may fulfill my vows ⌞daily⌟.
