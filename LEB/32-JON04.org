1. And this ⌞was greatly displeasing⌟ to Jonah, and ⌞he became furious⌟.
2. And he prayed to Yahweh and said, “O Yahweh, was this not ⌞what I said⌟ while I was in my homeland? Therefore ⌞I originally fled⌟ to Tarshish, because I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger ⌞and having great steadfast love⌟, and one who relents concerning calamity.
3. And so then, Yahweh, please take my life from me, because for me death is better than life!”
4. And Yahweh said, “⌞Is it right for you to be angry⌟?”
5. And Jonah went out from the city and sat down east of the city, and he made for himself a shelter there. And he sat under it in the shade, ⌞waiting to see⌟ what would happen with the city.
6. And Yahweh God appointed a plant, and he made it grow up over Jonah to be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. And Jonah ⌞was very glad⌟ about the plant.
7. So God appointed a worm ⌞at daybreak⌟ the next day, and it attacked the plant, and it withered.
8. ⌞And when the sun rose⌟, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head and he grew faint. ⌞And he asked that he could die⌟ and said, “My death is better than my life!”
9. So God said to Jonah, “⌞Is it right for you to be angry⌟ about the plant?” And he said, “⌞It is right for me to be angry enough to die⌟!”
10. But Yahweh said, “You are troubled about the plant, for which you did not labor nor cause it to grow. ⌞It grew up in a night and it perished in a night⌟!
11. And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, the great city, ⌞in which there are⌟ more ⌞than one hundred and twenty thousand⌟ people who do not know right from left, plus many animals?”
