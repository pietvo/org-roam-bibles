* Psalms 131 (LEB)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: LEB/19-PSA131
:END:

1. My heart is not haughty nor my eyes ⌞arrogant⌟. And I do not ⌞concern myself⌟ with things too great and difficult for me.
2. Rather I have soothed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother, like the weaned child is my soul with me.
3. O Israel, hope in Yahweh from now until forever.
