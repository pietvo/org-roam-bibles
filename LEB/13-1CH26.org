13. And they cast lots, small and great alike, by their fathers’ houses, ⌞for their gates⌟.
14. And the lot fell to the east to Shelemiah. As for Zechariah his son, ⌞a wise counselor⌟, they cast lots. And his lot came out for the north.

16. For Shuppim and Hosah it went out for the west, at the gate of Shalleketh, on the road that goes up, guard for guard.
17. To the east, six Levites; to the north, four daily; to the south, four daily; and at the storerooms, two by two.
18. For the court to the west, four at the road, two at the court.
19. These were the working groups of the gatekeepers among the sons of the Korahites and among the sons of Merari.
20. And of the Levites: Ahijah was over the treasuries of the house of God and over the treasuries of the sanctified objects.
21. The sons of Ladan: the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the ⌞families⌟ belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli.

25. And his brothers: from Eliezer were Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zikri his son, and Shelomoth his son.
26. That Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasuries of the sanctified objects that King David and the heads of the ⌞families⌟ to the commanders of thousands and hundreds and the commanders of the army had dedicated.
27. From the battles and from the spoil they had dedicated these things to strengthen the house of Yahweh.
28. And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah had dedicated—all the dedicated gifts were under the hand of Shelomith and his brothers.

32. And his brothers, sons of ability, were two thousand seven hundred heads of the ⌞families⌟, and King David appointed them over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, for every matter of God and matter of the king.
