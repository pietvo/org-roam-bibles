:END:

1. Hear my words, O Yahweh. Give heed to my sighing.
2. Listen to the sound of my pleading, my king and my God, for to you I pray.
3. O Yahweh, in the morning you will hear my voice. In the morning I will set forth my case to you and I will watch.
4. For you are not a God who desires wickedness. Evil cannot dwell with you.
5. The boastful do not stand before your eyes. You hate all evildoers.
6. You destroy speakers of lies. ⌞A man of bloodshed⌟ and deceit Yahweh abhors.
7. ⌞But as for me⌟, through the abundance of your steadfast love I will enter your house. I will bow down toward ⌞your holy temple⌟ in awe of you.
8. O Yahweh, lead me in your righteousness because of my enemies; make straight before me your way.
9. For there is not anything reliable in his mouth; their inner part is destruction. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongue they speak deceit.
10. Treat them as guilty, O God; let them fall because of their plans. Because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you.
11. But let all who take shelter in you rejoice. Let them ever sing for joy, ⌞because⌟ you spread protection over them; And let those who love your name exult in you.
12. For you bless the righteous. O Yahweh, like a shield you surround him with good favor.
