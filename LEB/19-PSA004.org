:END:

1. When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness. In trouble ⌞deliver me⌟. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.
2. O sons of man, how long will my honor be a disgrace? How long will you love vanity? How long will you seek lies? Selah
3. But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself the faithful one. Yahweh hears when I call to him.
4. Be disturbed but do not sin. Commune in your heart on your bed and be silent. Selah
5. Offer correct sacrifices, and ⌞trust in⌟ Yahweh.
6. Many are saying, “Who will show us something good?” Lift up over us the light of your face, O Yahweh.
7. You have put gladness in my heart more than ⌞when⌟ their grain and their wine abound.
8. In peace I will lie down and sleep ⌞at once⌟, for you alone, O Yahweh, make me dwell safely.
