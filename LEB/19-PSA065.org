1. Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion, and to you the vow shall be fulfilled.
2. O you who hear prayer, to you all flesh will come.
3. Iniquities prevail over me. As for our transgressions, you will ⌞forgive⌟ them.
4. Blessed is one whom you choose and bring near, that he may abide in your courts. We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house, your holy temple.
5. By awesome deeds in righteousness you will answer us, O God of our salvation, you who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth and of the far-off seas,
6. who established the mountains by his strength, the one who is girded with might,
7. who stills the roar of the seas, the roar of their waves, and the commotion of the peoples,
8. so that the inhabitants of the farthest reaches are in awe of your signs. You make the dawn and sunset sing for joy.
9. You care for the land and water it; you greatly enrich it. The stream of God is filled with waters. You provide their grain, for so you have established it.
10. You drench its furrows, penetrating its ridges. With rains you soften it; its growth you bless.
11. You crown the year with your ⌞bounty⌟, and your wagon paths drip with ⌞richness⌟.
12. They drop on the pastures of the wilderness, and the hills gird themselves with joy.
13. The pasturelands put on flocks, and the valleys clothe themselves with grain. They shout in triumph; they even sing.
