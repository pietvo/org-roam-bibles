1. Sing to Yahweh a new song, for he has done wonders. His right hand and his holy arm have secured his victory.
2. Yahweh has made known his salvation; to the eyes of the nations he has revealed his righteousness.
3. He has remembered his loyal love and his faithfulness to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
4. Shout joyfully to Yahweh, all the earth. Be cheerful and sing for joy and sing praises.
5. Sing praises to Yahweh with lyre, with lyre and melodious sound.
6. With trumpets and sound of horn, shout joyfully before the king, Yahweh.
7. Let the sea with its fullness roar, the world and those who live in it.
8. Let the rivers clap their hands. Let the hills sing joyfully together
9. before Yahweh, for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with equity.
