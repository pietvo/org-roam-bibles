:END:

1. I lift up my eyes to the mountains; whence will my help come?
2. My help is from Yahweh, maker of heaven and earth.
3. He will not allow your foot to be moved; he who protects you will not slumber.
4. Look, he will not slumber and he will not sleepâ€” he who protects Israel.
5. Yahweh is your protector; Yahweh is your shade at your right hand.
6. The sun will not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.
7. Yahweh will protect you from all evil; he will protect your life.
8. Yahweh will protect your going out and your coming in from now until forever.
