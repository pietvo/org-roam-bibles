1. I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.
2. Like a lily among the thorns, so is my love among the maidens.
3. As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. In his shade ⌞I sat down with delight⌟, and his fruit was sweet to my palate.
4. He brought me to the house of the wine, and his intention was love toward me.
5. Sustain me with the raisins, refresh me with the apples, ⌞for I am lovesick⌟.
6. His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.
7. I adjure you, ⌞O maidens of Jerusalem⌟, by the gazelles or by the does of the field, do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases!
8. The voice of my beloved! Look! Here ⌞he⌟ comes leaping upon the mountains, bounding over the hills!
9. My beloved is like a gazelle or ⌞a young stag⌟. Look! ⌞He is⌟ standing behind our wall, gazing ⌞through⌟ the window, looking ⌞through⌟ the lattice.
10. My beloved answered and said to me, “⌞Arise⌟, my beloved! ⌞Come, my beauty⌟!
11. For look! The winter is over; ⌞the rainy season⌟ ⌞has turned and gone away⌟.
12. The blossoms ⌞appear⌟ ⌞in the land⌟; ⌞the time of singing has arrived⌟; the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
13. The fig tree puts forth her figs, and the vines are in blossom; they give fragrance. ⌞Arise⌟, my beloved! ⌞Come, my beauty⌟!”
14. My dove, in the clefts of the rock, ⌞in the secluded place⌟ ⌞in the mountain⌟, Let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely.
15. Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes destroying vineyards, for our vineyards are in blossom!
16. ⌞My beloved belongs to me and I belong to him⌟; he pastures his flock among the lilies.
17. Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved! ⌞Be like⌟ a gazelle or ⌞young stag⌟ on the cleft mountains.
