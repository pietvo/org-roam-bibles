* Psalms 129 (LEB)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: LEB/19-PSA129
:END:

1. “Too often they have attacked me from my youth.” Let Israel say,
2. “Too often they have attacked me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me.
3. On my back plowmen have plowed. They have made their furrows long.”
4. Yahweh is righteous. He has cut the ropes of the wicked.
5. Let all be put to shame and repulsed who hate Zion.
6. Let them be like grass on the housetops, that withers before it grows up,
7. with which a reaper cannot fill his hand, nor the binder of sheaves his ⌞arms⌟,
8. so that passersby do not say, “The blessing of Yahweh be upon you. We bless you in the name of Yahweh.”
