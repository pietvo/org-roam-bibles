* Psalms 54 (LEB)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: LEB/19-PSA054
:END:

1. A maskil of David, when the Ziphites went and said to Saul, “Is not David hiding himself among us?” O God, by your name save me, and by your power vindicate me.
2. O God, hear my prayer; heed the words of my mouth.
3. For foreigners have risen against me, and ruthless men seek my life. They have not set God before them. Selah
4. See, God is my helper; The Lord is with those who sustain my life.
5. He will repay my enemies for their evil; in your faithfulness destroy them.
6. I will freely sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O Yahweh, because it is good.
7. Because he has delivered me from all trouble, and my eye has looked with satisfaction on my enemies.
