1. Moreover, Elihu ⌞spoke up⌟ and said,
2. “Do you think this is justice when you say, ‘⌞I am right⌟ before God’?
3. If you ask what it profits you: ‘How do I benefit ⌞by refraining from my sin⌟?’
4. I myself ⌞will give answer to you⌟ and to your friends with you.
5. “Look at the heavens, and see; and observe the clouds that are higher than you.
6. If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?
7. If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?
8. Your wickedness affects a person like yourself, and your righteousness affects humans.
9. “Because of the multitude of oppressions, they cry out; they cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.
10. But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
11. who teaches us more than the animals of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’
12. There they cry out, but he does not answer ⌞because of the pride of evildoers⌟.
13. “Surely God does not hear an empty plea, and Shaddai does not regard it.
14. ⌞How much less⌟ when you say that you do not see him, that the case is ⌞before him⌟, and you are waiting for him!
15. But now, because his anger does not punish, and he does not acknowledge the transgression at all,
16. ⌞therefore⌟ Job opens his mouth in empty talk— without knowledge he multiplies words.”
