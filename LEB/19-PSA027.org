1. Yahweh is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? Yahweh is the refuge of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
2. When evildoers drew near against me to eat my flesh— my adversaries and my enemies who drew near to me— they themselves stumbled and fell.
3. Though an army encamp against me, my heart will not fear. Though war arise against me, even in this I will remain confident.
4. One thing I have asked from Yahweh; it I will seek: that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Yahweh, and to consider his temple.
5. Because he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble. He will conceal me in the hiding place of his tent. He will set me high upon a rock.
6. And now my head will be high over my enemies round about me. And I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.
7. Hear, O Yahweh, my voice when I call, and be gracious to me and answer me.
8. On your behalf my heart says, “Seek my face.” Your face, O Yahweh, I do seek.
9. Do not hide your face from me; do not turn your servant away in anger. You have been my help; do not abandon nor forsake me, O God of my salvation.
10. If my father or my mother forsake me, then Yahweh will receive me.
11. Teach me, O Yahweh, your way, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies.
12. Do not give me over to the desire of my enemies, because false witnesses have arisen against me, and each breathing out violence.
13. Surely I believe that I will see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living.
14. Wait for Yahweh. Be strong and let your heart show strength, and wait for Yahweh.
