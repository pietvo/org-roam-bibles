:PROPERTIES:
:ID: LEB/20-PRO09
:END:

1. Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars.
2. She has slaughtered her slaughtering, mixed her wine, and also set her table.
3. She has sent her servant girls, she calls upon the wings of the high places of town,
4. “Whoever is simple, let him turn here.” As for the one who lacks ⌞sense⌟, she says to him,
5. “Come, eat with my bread; drink with the wine I have mixed.
6. Lay aside simplicity and live; walk in the way of understanding.”
7. He who corrects a scoffer gains abuse for himself, and he who rebukes the wicked ⌞gets hurt⌟.
8. Do not rebuke a scoffer, lest he hate you; rebuke the wise and he will love you.
9. Give to a wise one and he will become more wise; ⌞teach⌟ a righteous one and he will increase learning.
10. The start of wisdom is fear of Yahweh, and knowledge of the Holy One, insight.
11. For by me your days shall increase, and years of life shall multiply for you.
12. If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, and if you scoff, alone you shall bear it.
13. A woman of foolishness is loud, simple, and does not know ⌞it⌟.
14. She sits at the door of her house, upon a throne at the high places of town,
15. in order to call to those who pass by the road, those who go straight on their way:
16. “Whoever is simple, may he turn here!” As for he who lacks ⌞sense⌟, she says to him,
17. “Stolen waters are sweet, and bread of secrecy is pleasant.”
18. But he does not know that the dead are there, in the depths of Sheol are her guests.
