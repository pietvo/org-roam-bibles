1. Exult in Yahweh, O you righteous, for praise is fitting for the upright.
2. Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre; with a harp of ten strings play to him.
3. Sing to him a new song; play skillfully with jubilant shout.
4. For the word of Yahweh is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness.
5. He loves righteousness and justice. The earth is full of the loyal love of Yahweh.
6. By the word of Yahweh the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host.
7. He gathered the waters of the sea like a heap. He put the deeps in storehouses.
8. Let all the earth fear Yahweh. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
9. For ⌞he himself spoke⌟ and it came to pass. ⌞He himself commanded⌟ and it stood firm.
10. Yahweh brings to nothing the plan of nations; he frustrates the intents of peoples.
11. The plan of Yahweh stands firm forever, the intents of his heart ⌞from one generation to the next⌟.
12. Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh, the people he has chosen for his inheritance.
13. From heaven Yahweh looks; he sees all the children of humankind.
14. From his dwelling place he gazes on all the inhabitants of the earth,
15. he who fashions altogether their heart, he who understands all their works.
16. The king is not saved by the greatness of an army. The warrior is not delivered by the greatness of strength.
17. The horse is a false hope for victory, nor can it save by the greatness of its power.
18. Behold, the eye of Yahweh is on those who fear him, on those who hope for his loyal love
19. to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine.
20. Our soul waits for Yahweh; he is our help and our shield.
21. For in him our heart rejoices because in his holy name we trust.
22. Let your loyal love, O Yahweh, be upon us, ⌞even as⌟ we hope in you.
