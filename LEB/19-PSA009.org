:END:

1. I will thank Yahweh with all my heart. I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
2. I will be glad and rejoice in you. I will sing the praise of your name, O Most High.
3. When my enemies turn back, they will stumble and perish because of your presence.
4. For you have maintained my just cause; you have sat on the throne judging correctly.
5. You have rebuked the nations; you have destroyed the wicked. Their name you have blotted out forever and ever.
6. The enemies are destroyed in ruins forever, and you have uprooted their cities; their very memory has perished.
7. But Yahweh sits enthroned forever. He has established his throne for judgment.
8. And he will judge the world with righteousness. He will judge the peoples with equity.
9. And Yahweh will be a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of distress.
10. And those who know your name will trust in you, for you do not forsake those who seek you, O Yahweh.
11. Sing praises to Yahweh who sits enthroned in Zion. Tell his deeds among the peoples,
12. for he who ⌞avenges bloodshed⌟ remembers them. He does not forget the distressed cry of the afflicted.
13. Be gracious to me, O Yahweh. See my suffering from those who hate me, you who lift me up from the gates of death,
14. so that I may tell of all your praises. In the gates of the daughter of Zion let me rejoice in your salvation.
15. The nations have fallen in the pit that they made; their foot is caught in the net that they hid.
16. Yahweh has made himself known; he has executed judgment. The wicked is snared by the work of his hands. Higgaion Selah
17. The wicked shall turn back to Sheol, all the nations forgetting God,
18. for the needy shall not always be forgotten; the hope of the poor shall never perish.
19. Rise up, O Yahweh, let not humans prevail; let the nations be judged before you.
20. O Yahweh, put them in fear. Let the nations know they are merely human. Selah
