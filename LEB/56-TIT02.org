1. But you, speak the things which are fitting for sound instruction.
2. Older men are to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in endurance.
3. Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good,
4. in order that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands and to love their children,
5. to be self-controlled, pure, busy at home, good, being subject to their own husbands, in order that the word of God may not be slandered.
6. Likewise, exhort the young men to be self-controlled,
7. concerning everything showing yourself to be an example of good deeds, in your teaching demonstrating soundness, dignity,
8. a sound message beyond reproach, in order that ⌞an opponent⌟ may be put to shame, because he has nothing bad to say concerning us.
9. Slaves must be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not to talk back,
10. not stealing, but demonstrating all good faith, in order that they may do credit to the teaching of God our Savior in everything.
11. For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people,
12. training us in order that, denying impiety and worldly desires, we may live self-controlled and righteously and godly in the present age,
13. looking forward to the blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
14. who gave himself for us, in order that he might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good deeds.
15. Speak these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
