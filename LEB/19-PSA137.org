* Psalms 137 (LEB)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: LEB/19-PSA137
:END:

1. By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat, yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
2. On the willows in her midst, we hung up our lyres.
3. For there our captors asked of us words of a song, and our tormentors asked of us jubilation, “Sing for us from a song of Zion.”
4. How could we sing the song of Yahweh in ⌞a foreign land⌟?
5. If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget.
6. Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, if do not I exalt Jerusalem above my highest joy.
7. Remember, O Yahweh, against the sons of Edom the day of Jerusalem, the ones who said, “Lay it bare! Lay it bare to its foundation!”
8. O daughter of Babylon, about to be devastated, happy shall be he who pays back to you ⌞what you paid out to us⌟.
9. Happy shall be he who seizes and smashes your children against the rock.
