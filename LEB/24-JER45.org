1. The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch, the son of Neriah, at his writing these words on a scroll from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, ⌞saying⌟,
2. “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
3. ‘You said, “Woe please to me, for Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain. I am weary in my groaning and I do not find rest.” ’
4. Thus you will say to him: ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Look, what I have built I am about to tear down, and what I have planted I am about to pluck up, it is all the land.
5. And you, do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek great things, for look, I am about to bring disaster upon all flesh,” ⌞declares⌟ Yahweh, “but to you I will give your life as booty in all the places where you may go.” ’ ”
