1. Shout in triumph to Yahweh, all the earth.
2. Serve Yahweh with joy; come into his presence with exultation.
3. Know that Yahweh, he is God; he made us and we are his. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
4. Enter his gates with thanksgiving, his courts with praise. Give thanks to him; bless his name.
5. For Yahweh is good; his loyal love is forever, and his faithfulness is ⌞from generation to generation⌟.
