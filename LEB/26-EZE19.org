1. “And you, raise a lament about the leaders of Israel,
2. and you must say, ‘What a lioness was your mother among the lions. She lay down in the midst of young lions, and she reared her lion cubs.
3. And she raised up one from her cubs; he became a fierce lion, and he learned to tear prey; he ate humans.
4. And nations heard about him; in their pit he was caught, and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
5. And she saw that she was waiting in vain; her hope was destroyed, and she took one from her cubs, and she made him a fierce lion.
6. And he walked about in the midst of lions; he became a fierce lion, and he learned to tear prey; he ate humans.
7. And he knew their widows, and he devastated their cities, and the land was appalled, and ⌞everyone in it⌟ at the sound of his roar.
8. And nations set out against him ⌞from the surrounding provinces⌟, and they spread their net over him, and he was caught in their pit.
9. And they put him in a collar with hooks, and they brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into a prison, so that his voice would not be heard ⌞any longer⌟ on the mountains of Israel.
10. Your mother was like the vine in your vineyard; planted ⌞fruitfully⌟ beside water, and it was full of branches from many waters.
11. And ⌞she produced branches of strength⌟ to scepters of rulers; its height became tall between thick foliage, and it was seen because of its tallness among the abundance of its branches.
12. But it was uprooted in rage; it was thrown to the earth, and the east wind dried up its fruit; they were stripped off, and its strong branch dried up; fire consumed it.
13. And now it is planted in the desert, in a ⌞dry and thirsty land⌟.
14. And so fire has gone out from the stem of its branches; its fruit it has consumed, and there was not in it ⌞a strong branch⌟, a scepter for ruling.’ ” This is a lament, and ⌞it will be used as a lament⌟.
