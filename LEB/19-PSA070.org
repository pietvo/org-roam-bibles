1. O God, make haste to deliver me. O Yahweh, make haste to help me.
2. Let them be ashamed and abashed who seek my life. Let them be repulsed and humiliated who desire my harm.
3. let them turn back because of their shame, those who say, “Aha! Aha!”
4. Let them rejoice and be glad in you, all those who seek you. Let them say continually, “God is great!” those who love your salvation.
5. But I am poor and needy; O God hasten to me. You are my help and my deliverer. O Yahweh, do not delay.
