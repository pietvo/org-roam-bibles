1. And the word of Yahweh ⌞came⌟ to me, ⌞saying⌟,
2. “Son of man, how will the wood of the vine be ⌞better than⌟ ⌞any of the wood of⌟ the branch which is among the trees of the forest?
3. Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can they take a tent peg from it to hang on it any object?
4. Look! It is given to the fire as fuel. The fire will consume two of its ends, and its middle will be charred. Is it useful for anything?
5. Look! ⌞When it is in perfect condition⌟, it will not be used for anything, ⌞how much less⌟ ⌞when the fire has consumed it⌟ and it is charred; and then can it be used again for anything?
6. Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ⌞Just like⌟ the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest which I gave to the fire for fuel, so I have given the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
7. And I will set my face against them. From the fire they may⌞escape⌟, but the fire will yet consume them, and they will know that I am Yahweh ⌞when I set my face against them⌟.
8. And I will make the land a desolation because ⌞they acted very unfaithfully⌟!” ⌞declares⌟ the Lord Yahweh.
