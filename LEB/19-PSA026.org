1. Judge me, O Yahweh, because I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted Yahweh and not wavered.
2. Prove me, O Yahweh, and test me. Try my ⌞innermost being⌟ and my ⌞mind⌟.
3. Because your loyal love is before my eyes, and I walk about in your faithfulness.
4. I do not sit with deceitful people, nor will I go about with hypocrites.
5. I hate the crowd of evildoers, and with the wicked I will not sit.
6. I will wash my hands in innocence, and I will walk about your altar, O Yahweh,
7. to declare with a voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all your wondrous deeds.
8. O Yahweh, I love the dwelling of your house, and ⌞the place where your glory abides⌟.
9. Do not destroy me with the sinners, nor my life with men of bloodshed,
10. in whose hands is an evil plan, and whose right hand is full of bribes.
11. But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me and be gracious to me.
12. My foot stands on level ground. In assemblies I will bless Yahweh.
