1. Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,
2. “Should an abundance of words go unanswered, or ⌞a man full of talk⌟ be vindicated?
3. Should your loose talk put people to silence? ⌞And when you mock, shall no one put you to shame⌟?
4. For you say, ‘My teaching is pure, and I am clean in your sight.’
5. But, ⌞O that⌟ God might speak, and that he would open his lips to you,
6. and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom, for ⌞insight has many sides⌟. And know that God ⌞on your behalf⌟ has forgotten ⌞some of⌟ your guilt.
7. “Can you find out the essence of God, or can you find out ⌞the ultimate limits⌟ of Shaddai?
8. ⌞It is higher than the heaven⌟; what can you do? It is deeper than Sheol; what can you know?
9. Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea.
10. “If he passes through and imprisons someone ⌞and summons the assembly⌟, then who can hinder him?
11. For he knows ⌞those who are worthless⌟; ⌞when he sees⌟ iniquity, ⌞he will not consider it⌟.
12. But ⌞an empty-headed person⌟ will get understanding when a wild donkey’s colt is born as a human being.
13. “If you yourself direct your heart and stretch out your hands to him—
14. if iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and you must not let wickedness reside in your tents—
15. surely then you will lift up your face without blemish, and you will be firmly established and will not fear.
16. For you yourself will forget your misery; you will remember it as water that has flowed past.
17. “⌞And your life will be brighter than noon⌟; its darkness will be like the morning.
18. And you will have confidence because there is hope; and you will be well protected—⌞you will sleep in safety⌟.
19. And you will lie down, and ⌞no one will make you afraid⌟; ⌞and many will entreat your favor⌟.
20. But the eyes of the wicked will fail; and refuge will be lost to them, and their hope is ⌞to breathe their last breath⌟.”
