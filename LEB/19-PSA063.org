1. O God, you are my God; I will seek you diligently. My soul thirsts for you; my flesh longs for you as in a dry and weary land without water.
2. Thus I have seen you in the sanctuary, beholding your strength and glory.
3. Because your loyal love is better than life, my lips will praise you.
4. So I will bless you while I live. I will lift up my ⌞hands⌟ in your name.
5. My soul will be satisfied as with the best and richest food, and with joyful lips my mouth will praise.
6. When I remember you on my bed, I meditate on you in the night watches.
7. Because you have been my help, therefore in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.
8. My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.
9. But as for them who seek my life for ruin, they will go into the depths of the earth.
10. They who would ⌞deliver him to the sword⌟ will become a portion for jackals.
11. However, the king will rejoice in God. Everyone who swears an oath by him will boast, because the mouth of the liars will be stopped.
