* Isaiah 25 (LEB)

:END:

1. Yahweh, you are my God; I will exalt you. I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, plans ⌞of old⌟, in faithfulness, trustworthiness.
2. For you have ⌞made⌟ the city a heap, the fortified city a ruin, the palace of foreigners ⌞is no longer⌟ a city; it will ⌞never⌟ be rebuilt.
3. Therefore strong peoples will glorify you; a city of ruthless nations, they will fear you.
4. For you have been a refuge to the poor, a refuge to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the rainstorm, a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless was like a rainstorm against a wall,
5. the noise of foreigners like heat in a dry land. You subdued the heat with the shade of a cloud; the song of the ruthless was silenced.
6. And on this mountain Yahweh of hosts will make for all peoples a ⌞rich feast⌟, a feast of aged wines, fat filled with marrow, filtered aged wine.
7. And on this mountain he will ⌞destroy⌟ the face of the shroud, the shroud over all peoples, and the woven covering over all nations.
8. He will ⌞destroy⌟ death forever, and the Lord Yahweh will wipe off the tears from all faces, and he will remove the disgrace of his people from all the earth, for Yahweh has spoken.
9. And one will say, on that day, “Look! This is our God! We have waited for him and he saved us! This is Yahweh; we waited for him! Let us be glad, and let us rejoice in his salvation.”
10. For the hand of Yahweh will rest on this mountain, and Moab shall be trampled down under him as ⌞a heap of straw is trampled down⌟ in ⌞waters of⌟ a dung heap.
11. And it will spread out its hands in the midst of it, just as the swimmer spreads out to swim, and its pride will be brought low with the movement of its hands.
12. And he will throw down the fortification of the high point of your walls; he will bring it low; he will ⌞send it⌟ to the ground, to the dust.
