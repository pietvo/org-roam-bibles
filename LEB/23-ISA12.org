1. And you will say on that day, “I will give you thanks, Yahweh, for though you were angry with me, your anger turned away, and you comforted me.
2. Look! God is my salvation; I will trust, and I will not be afraid, for my strength and might is Yah, Yahweh; and he has become salvation for me.”
3. And you will draw water from the wells of salvation in joy.
4. And you will say on that day, “Give thanks to Yahweh; call on his name. Make his deeds known among the peoples; bring to remembrance that his name is exalted.
5. Sing praises to Yahweh, for he has done a glorious thing; this is known in all the earth.
6. Inhabitant of Zion, shout out and sing for joy, for the holy one of Israel is great in your midst.”
