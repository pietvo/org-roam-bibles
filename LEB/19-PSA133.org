:END:

1. Look, how good and how pleasant it is when brothers dwell together in unity.
2. It is like the fragrant oil upon the head, running down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron, that runs down upon the edges of his robes.
3. It is like the dew of Hermon that runs down upon the mountains of Zion, because there Yahweh commanded the blessingâ€” life forever.
