1. Rescue me, O Yahweh, from evil men. Preserve me from violent men,
2. who plan evil things in their heart. They stir up wars continually.
3. They sharpen their tongue as sharp as a snake’s; the venom of a viper is under their lips. Selah
4. Protect me, O Yahweh, from the hands of the wicked. Preserve me from violent men, who have planned to ⌞make me stumble⌟.
5. The proud have hidden a trap for me, and cords. They have spread out a net along the ⌞side⌟ of the path. They have set snares for me. Selah
6. I say to Yahweh, “You are my God.” Listen, O Yahweh, to the voice of my supplications.
7. O Yahweh, my Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle.
8. Do not grant, O Yahweh, the desires of the wicked. Do not allow them to attain their plan, lest they be exalted. Selah
9. With respect to the head of those who surround me, may the harm of their lips cover them.
10. Let burning coals fall on them; let them be dropped into the fire, into bottomless pits from which they cannot rise.
11. Do not let a ⌞slanderer⌟ be established in the land; as for the man of violence, let evil hunt him quickly.
12. I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and justice for the needy.
13. Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name; the upright will dwell in your presence.
