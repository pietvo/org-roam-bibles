:END:

1. Yahweh is great and very worthy of praise in the city of our God, in his ⌞holy mountain⌟.
2. Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is ⌞Mount Zion⌟, ⌞in the far north⌟, the city of the great king.
3. God is in her citadels; he is known as a high stronghold.
4. For see, the kings assembled; they advanced together.
5. ⌞They themselves saw⌟ it, so they were astonished. They were terrified; they ran off.
6. Trembling seized them there— pain as of a woman in labor.
7. With an east wind you shatter the ships of Tarshish.
8. As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of Yahweh of hosts, in the city of our God. God will establish her forever. Selah
9. We have pondered your loyal love, O God, in the midst of your temple.
10. As is your name, O God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness.
11. Let ⌞Mount Zion⌟ rejoice; let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.
12. Walk about Zion and circle it; count her towers.
13. ⌞Consider well⌟ her ramparts. Go through her citadels so that you can tell the next generation
14. that this is God, our God forever and ever. ⌞He himself⌟ will guide us until death.
