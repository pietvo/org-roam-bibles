4. You will offer one male lamb in the morning, and the second male lamb you will offer ⌞at twilight⌟,
5. and a tenth of an ephah of finely milled flour as a grain offering, mixed with a fourth of a measure of beaten oil.
6. It is a continual burnt offering that was ⌞ordained⌟ on Mount Sinai as a fragrance of appeasement, an offering made by fire for Yahweh.
7. The libation with it will be a fourth of a liquid measure for each male lamb; in the sanctuary you will pour out the libation of fermented drink for Yahweh.
8. And the second male lamb you will offer ⌞at twilight⌟; as the grain offering of the morning and as its libation you will offer it, an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh.
9. “ ‘On the day of the Sabbath, two male lambs without defect ⌞in their first year⌟, and two-tenths of finely milled flour mixed with oil for a grain offering and its libation.

13. and a tenth of finely milled flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each male lamb, for a burnt offering of a fragrance of appeasement, an offering of fire for Yahweh.
