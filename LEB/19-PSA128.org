:END:

1. Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh, who walks in his ways.
2. You will indeed eat of the labor of your hands; you will be happy and it will be well with you.
3. Your wife will be like a fruitful vine ⌞within⌟ your house. Your children will be like olive shoots about your table.
4. Look, for thus shall a man be blessed ⌞who fears Yahweh⌟.
5. May Yahweh bless you from Zion, that you may see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life,
6. and that you may see your children’s children. May peace be upon Israel.
