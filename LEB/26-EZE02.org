1. And he said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, so that I can speak with you.”
2. And the Spirit came into me as he was speaking to me, and it set me on my feet, and I heard the one speaking to me.
3. And he said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the ⌞Israelites⌟, to nations who are rebelling, who rebelled against me, they and their ancestors, they transgressed against me ⌞until this very day⌟.
4. And the children are ⌞impudent⌟ and ⌞stubborn⌟, and so I am sending you to them, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh!’
5. And they, whether they listen or whether they fail to listen, for they are a rebellious house, they will know that a prophet was in their midst.
6. And you, son of man, you must not be afraid of them, and you must not be afraid of their words, because briers and thorns are with you, and you are sitting among scorpions. You must not be afraid of their words, and you must not be dismayed because of their ⌞looks⌟, for they are a rebellious house.
7. And you must speak my words to them whether they listen or whether they fail to listen, for they are rebellious.
8. And you, son of man, hear what I am speaking to you: you must not be rebellious like the house of rebellion. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving to you.”
9. And I looked, and look! There was a hand stretched out to me, and look! In it was ⌞a scroll with writing⌟.
10. And he rolled it out ⌞before me⌟, and it was written on the front and back, and there were written on it laments and mourning and wailing.
