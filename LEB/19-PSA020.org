1. May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble. May the name of Jacob’s God protect you.
2. May he send you help from the sanctuary, and from Zion may he sustain you.
3. May he remember all your offerings, and your burnt offering may he ⌞regard favorably⌟.
4. May he give to you ⌞your heart’s desire⌟, and your every plan may he fulfill. Selah
5. May we shout for joy over your victory, and in the name of our God may we set up banners. May Yahweh fulfill all your requests.
6. Now I know that Yahweh will help his anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven with the victorious power of his right hand.
7. ⌞Some boast in chariots and others in horses⌟, but we boast in the name of Yahweh, our God.
8. They will collapse and fall, and we will rise and stand firm.
9. Rescue, O Yahweh. Let the king answer us when we call.
