:END:

1. Yahweh is king; he clothes himself with majesty. Yahweh clothes himself; he girds himself with might. Yes, the world is established so that it will not be moved.
2. Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting.
3. The rivers have lifted up, O Yahweh; the rivers have lifted up their ⌞rumbling⌟; the rivers have lifted up their pounding.
4. Mightier than the rumblings of many waters, mightier than the mighty breakers of the sea, Yahweh on high is mighty.
5. Your testimonies are fully reliable. Holiness is fitting for your house, O Yahweh, ⌞forever⌟.
