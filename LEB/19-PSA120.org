* Psalms 120 (LEB)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: LEB/19-PSA120
:END:

1. In my distress I called to Yahweh, and he answered me.
2. “Deliver my life, O Yahweh, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.”
3. What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you, deceitful tongue?
4. The sharpened arrows of a warrior, with burning charcoals from broom trees.
5. Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar.
6. Too long my soul has had its dwelling near one who hates peace.
7. I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.
