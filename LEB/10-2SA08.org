2. When he defeated Moab, he measured them with the cord, making them lie on the ground. He measured two cords to kill and ⌞the third cord⌟ to let live. So Moab became servants of David, bringing tribute.

11. King David dedicated them also to Yahweh along with the silver and the gold that he had dedicated from all of the nations which he had subdued;
12. from Aram and from Moab and from the ⌞Ammonites⌟ and from the Philistines and from Amalek and from the plunder of Hadadezer the son of Rehob, the king of Zobah.
