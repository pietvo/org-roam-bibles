1. In Yahweh I have taken refuge; how can you say to my soul, “Flee to your mountain like a bird”?
2. For look: The wicked ⌞string the bow⌟. They have fitted their arrow to the string, to shoot from the darkness at the upright of heart.
3. When the foundations are destroyed what can the righteous do?
4. Yahweh is in his holy temple; Yahweh is in the heavens on his throne. His eyelids see; they test the children of humankind.
5. Yahweh tests the righteous, but the wicked and the lover of violence his soul hates.
6. He will rain coals on the wicked. Burning sulfur and scorching wind will be the portion of their cup.
7. For Yahweh is righteous; he loves righteous deeds. The upright shall see his face.
