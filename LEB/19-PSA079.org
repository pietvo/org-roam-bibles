:END:

1. O God, the nations have entered your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have reduced Jerusalem to ruins.
2. They have given the bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the heavens, the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth.
3. They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.
4. We have become a taunt to our neighbors, a derision and a scorn to those around us.
5. How long, O Yahweh? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?
6. Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call on your name,
7. because they have devoured Jacob and have laid waste his habitation.
8. Do not remember against us former iniquities; let your mercies meet us quickly because we are brought very low.
9. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; and deliver us and forgive our sins for the sake of your name.
10. Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let it be known among the nations before our eyes, by the avenging of the blood of your servants that was poured out.
11. Let the groaning of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your ⌞power⌟, spare the children appointed to death.
12. And return to our neighbors sevenfold ⌞upon them⌟ their taunts with which they taunted you, O Lord.
13. Then we, your people and the flock of your pasture, we will give thanks to you forever. ⌞Generation after generation⌟ we will tell of your praise.
