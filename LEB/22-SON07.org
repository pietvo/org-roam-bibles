1. How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O royal princess! The curves of your ⌞thighs⌟ are like ⌞jewels⌟, the work of the hands of a craftsman.
2. Your navel is ⌞a round wine-mixing bowl⌟ that does not lack mixed wine! Your belly is a heap of wheat encircled with lilies.
3. Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
4. Your neck is like a tower of ivory; your eyes are pools in Heshbon at the gate of Beth Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon ⌞looking out over Damascus⌟.
5. ⌞Your head crowns you like Carmel⌟; the flowing locks of your head are like ⌞purple tapestry⌟; a king is held captive in the tresses!
6. How beautiful you are and how pleasant, O loved one in the delights!
7. ⌞Your stature⌟ is like the palm tree, and your breasts are like clusters.
8. I say, “I will climb up the palm tree; I will lay hold of its fruit clusters.” Let your breasts be pleasing like clusters of the vine and the scent of your breath like the apples.
9. Your palate is like the best wine that goes down for my beloved, smoothly gliding over my lips and teeth.
10. ⌞I belong to my beloved⌟, ⌞and he desires me⌟!
11. Come, my beloved, let us ⌞go out to the countryside⌟; let us spend the night in the villages.
12. Let us rise early to go to the vineyards; let us see whether the vine has budded, whether the grape blossom has opened, and whether the pomegranates ⌞are in bloom⌟; there I will give my love to you.
13. The mandrakes give off their fragrance, and ⌞over our doorway is every kind of delicious fruit⌟; both ⌞fresh and dried fruit I have stored up⌟ for you, O my beloved.
