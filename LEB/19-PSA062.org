:END:

1. A psalm of David. Only for God my soul waits in silence. From him is my salvation.
2. Only he is my rock and my salvation, my high stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken.
3. How long will you attack a man? All of you will be shattered like a leaning wall, a tottering fence.
4. They only plan to thrust him down from his high position; they are pleased with deception. With their mouths they bless, but ⌞inwardly⌟ they curse. Selah
5. Only for God wait in silence, O my soul, because my hope is from him.
6. Only he is my rock and my salvation, my high stronghold; I shall not be shaken.
7. On God rests my salvation and my glory; God is my strong rock, my refuge.
8. Trust him at all times, O people; pour out before him your heart. God is a refuge for us. Selah
9. Only a vapor are men of low degree, a deception are men of high degree. ⌞Weighed⌟ in a balance, together they are lighter than a vapor.
10. Do not trust in extortion, and do not put vain confidence in robbery. If wealth increases, do not set your heart on it.
11. Once God has spoken; twice I have heard this: that strength belongs to God.
12. And to you belongs loyal love, O Lord, because you will render to each according to his work.
