1. Yahweh spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, in the tent of assembly, on the first of the month, in the second year ⌞after they came out⌟ of the land of Egypt, saying,
2. “⌞Take a census of⌟ the entire community of the ⌞Israelites⌟ according to their clans and ⌞their families⌟, according to the number of names, every male individually
3. from ⌞twenty years old⌟ and above, everyone in Israel who is able to go to war. You and Aaron must muster them for their wars.
4. A man from each tribe will be with you, each man the head of ⌞his family⌟.
5. And these are the names of the men who will ⌞assist you⌟: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur;
6. from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai;
7. from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab;
8. from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar;
9. from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon.
10. From the descendants of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.
11. From Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni;

16. These are the ones summoned from the community, the leaders of their ancestors’ tribes; they are the heads of Israel’s clans.
17. So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name,
18. and they summoned the entire community on the first day of the second month. And they registered themselves among their clans according to ⌞their families⌟, according to the number of names from ⌞those twenty years old⌟ and above individually,

41. those who were counted from the tribe of Asher were forty-one thousand five hundred.
42. From the descendants of Naphtali, their genealogies according to their clans, according to ⌞their families⌟, according to the number of names, from ⌞those twenty years old⌟ and above, everyone who is able to go to war:
43. those who were counted from the tribe of Naphtali were fifty-three thousand four hundred.
44. These are the ones counted whom Moses and Aaron mustered, with the twelve leaders of Israel, each one from ⌞his family⌟.
45. So all those who were counted from the ⌞Israelites⌟ according to ⌞their families⌟, from ⌞those twenty years old⌟ and above, everyone in Israel who is able to go to war.
46. All of the ones counted were six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty.
47. The Levites from their ancestors’ tribe were not mustered in their midst.
48. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
49. “You will not muster the tribe of Levi, and you will not ⌞take a census of⌟ them in the midst of the ⌞Israelites⌟.
50. You will ⌞appoint⌟ them over the tabernacle of the testimony, over all its vessels, and over all that belongs to it. They will carry the tabernacle and all its vessels, and they will care for it; and they will camp around the tabernacle.
51. And when the tabernacle is set out, the Levites will ⌞take it down⌟, and when encamping the tabernacle the Levites will set it up; the stranger that approaches it will be put to death.
52. The ⌞Israelites⌟ will encamp, each in their own camp, and each by their own banner according to their divisions.
53. But the Levites will encamp around the tabernacle of the testimony, and there will not be wrath on the community of the ⌞Israelites⌟; and the Levites will keep the requirements of the tabernacle of the testimony.”
54. And the ⌞Israelites⌟ did thus; they did everything that Yahweh commanded Moses.
