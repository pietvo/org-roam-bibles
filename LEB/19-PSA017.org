1. O Yahweh, hear a just cause. Hear my cry; heed my prayer I make without deceitful lips.
2. Let my vindication come forth from you; let your eyes see fairness.
3. You have tried my heart; you have examined me by night; you have tested me; you found nothing. I have decided that my mouth will not transgress.
4. As for the works of humankind, by the word of your lips, I have kept from the ways of the violent.
5. I have held my steps in your path My feet will not slip.
6. As for me, I have called on you because you will answer me, O God. Incline your ear to me. Hear my words.
7. Show wondrously your acts of loyal love, O Savior of those who take refuge at your right hand from those who rise up against them.
8. Keep me as ⌞the apple of your eye⌟. Hide me in the shadow of your wings
9. from the ⌞presence⌟ of the wicked who destroy me, those enemies against my life, they that surround me.
10. They have shut off their calloused heart; with their mouth they speak arrogantly.
11. Now they surround us at our every step. They ⌞intend⌟ ⌞to pin⌟ me to the ground.
12. ⌞He is like⌟ a lion; he longs to tear apart, and like a strong lion crouching in hiding places.
13. Rise up, O Yahweh, confront ⌞him⌟. Make him bow down. Rescue with your sword my life from the wicked,
14. from men by your hand, O Yahweh, from men of this world. Their share is in ⌞this life⌟, and you fill their stomach with your treasure. They are satisfied with children. They bequeath their excess to their children.
15. By contrast, I in righteousness shall see your face. Upon awakening I will be satisfied seeing your form.
