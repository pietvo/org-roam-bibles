1. Then these three men ceased from answering Job because he was righteous in his own eyes.
2. So Elihu the son of Barakel the Buzite, from the clan of Ram, ⌞became angry⌟. ⌞He became angry⌟ at Job because he justified himself rather than God,
3. and ⌞he became angry⌟ at his three friends because they had not found an answer, and they had declared Job guilty.
4. Thus Elihu had waited for Job ⌞to speak⌟ because ⌞they were older than he⌟.
5. When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, ⌞he became angry⌟.
6. Then Elihu the son of Barakel the Buzite ⌞spoke up⌟ and said, “⌞I am young⌟, but you are old; therefore I feared and became afraid of explaining my knowledge to you.
7. I thought, ‘Let days speak, and let many years teach wisdom.’
8. “Truly, it is a spirit in a human being, and the breath of Shaddai teaches them.
9. It is not ⌞the aged⌟ who are wise, or it is not the elders who understand justice.
10. Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; let me also declare my knowledge myself.’
11. “Look, I waited for your words; I listened for your insight, until you searched out ⌞what to say⌟.
12. And I directed my attention to you; and, look, there is no one for Job who refuted, answering his words among you.
13. So do not say, ‘We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not a man.’
14. But he did not direct his words to me, and I will not answer him with your words.
15. “They are dismayed; they no longer answer; ⌞they have nothing to say⌟.
16. And I have waited because they do not speak, because they stand there and no longer answer.
17. I myself will answer my share also; I myself will declare my knowledge also,
18. for I am full of words; ⌞the spirit within me⌟ urges me.
19. “Look, my internal organs are like unopened wine, like new wineskins it is ready to burst open.
20. Let me speak ⌞that I may find relief⌟; let me open my lips, and let me answer.
21. ⌞Please let me not show partiality to anyone⌟, and let me not show flattery to human beings,
22. for I do not know how ⌞to flatter⌟, else my Maker would ⌞soon⌟ put an end to me.
