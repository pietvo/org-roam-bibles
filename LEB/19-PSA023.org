1. Yahweh is my shepherd; I will not lack for anything.
2. In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by quiet waters he leads me.
3. He restores my life. He leads me in ⌞correct paths⌟ for the sake of his name.
4. Even when I walk in a dark valley, I fear no evil because you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
5. You prepare before me a table in the presence of my oppressors. You anoint my head with oil; my cup is overflowing.
6. Surely goodness and loyal love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will stay in the house of Yahweh ⌞for a very long time⌟.
