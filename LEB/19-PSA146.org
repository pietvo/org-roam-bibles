* Psalms 146 (LEB)

:END:

1. Praise Yah. Praise Yahweh, O my soul.
2. I will praise Yahweh while I live; I will sing praises to my God while I am still alive.
3. Do not place trust in princes, in a son of humankind with whom there is no deliverance.
4. His breath departs; he returns to his plot; on that day his plans perish.
5. Blessed is the one whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is on Yahweh as his God,
6. who made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them, the one who keeps faith forever,
7. who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food for the hungry. Yahweh sets prisoners free;
8. Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind; Yahweh raises up those bowed down; Yahweh loves the righteous;
9. Yahweh protects the strangers. He helps up the orphan and the widow, but the way of the wicked he ⌞thwarts⌟.
10. Yahweh will reign forever, Your God, O Zion, ⌞throughout all generations⌟. Praise Yah.
