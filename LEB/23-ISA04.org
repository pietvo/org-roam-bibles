* Isaiah 4 (LEB)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: LEB/23-ISA04
:END:

1. And seven women shall grasp at one man on that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread, and we will wear our own clothing; only ⌞let us be called by your name⌟! Take away our disgrace!”
2. On that day the branch of Yahweh shall become beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall become the pride and glory of the survivors of Israel.
3. And this shall happen: He who is left in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone written for life in Jerusalem,
4. when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the blood of Jerusalem from her midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning.
5. Then Yahweh will create over all of the site of ⌞Mount Zion⌟ and over her assembly a cloud by day and smoke and the brightness of flaming fire by night. Indeed, over all the glory there will be a canopy,
6. and it will be a shelter for shade from the heat by day, and a refuge and a hiding place from rainstorm and from rain.
