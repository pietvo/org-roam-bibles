1. And the word of Yahweh ⌞came⌟ to me, ⌞saying⌟,
2. “Son of man, set your face against the mountain of Seir and prophesy against it,
3. and you must say to it, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am against you, mountain of Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you a desolation and a wasteland.
4. Your cities I will make ruins, and you will be a desolation, and then you will know that I am Yahweh,
5. because there has been to you ⌞an ancient hostility⌟, and you handed over the ⌞Israelites⌟ to the power of the sword at the time of their disaster, at the time of ⌞their final punishment⌟.
6. Therefore ⌞as I live⌟,” ⌞declares⌟ the Lord Yahweh, “Certainly to blood guilt I will prepare you and blood will pursue; ⌞since⌟ ⌞you did not hate blood⌟, it will pursue you.
7. And I will make the mountain of Seir into a desolation and ruin, and I will cut off from it both he who is crossing over and he who is returning.
8. And I will fill its mountains with its slain; your hills and your valleys and all of your watercourses, the slain by the sword will fall in them.
9. ⌞An everlasting desolation⌟ I will make you, and your cities will not return, and you will know that I am Yahweh.
10. I do this because of your saying, ‘The two nations and the two lands, they will be ⌞mine⌟, and we will take possession of it,’ and yet Yahweh was there.
11. Therefore, ⌞as I live⌟,” ⌞declares⌟ the Lord Yahweh, “so I will deal with you according to your anger and according to your jealousy that you did, because of your hatred against them, and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.
12. And you will know that I, Yahweh, I have heard all of your contemptible words that you said against the mountains of Israel, ⌞saying⌟, ‘They will be desolate; they are given to us as food.’
13. And you magnified yourself against me with your ⌞insolent speech⌟, and you spoke voluminously against me with your words—I heard!
14. Thus the Lord Yahweh says, ‘⌞As the whole world rejoices⌟, I will make you a desolation.
15. ⌞Like your rejoicing over the inheritance of the house of Israel⌟ ⌞because⌟ it was desolate, I will do to you; you will be a desolation, mountain of Seir and all of Edom, indeed all of it; and they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” ’
