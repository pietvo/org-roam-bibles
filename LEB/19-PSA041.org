* Psalms 41 (LEB)

:END:

1. Blessed is the one who has regard for the poor; in the day of disaster, Yahweh delivers him.
2. Yahweh protects him and keeps him alive; he is blessed in the land, and you do not give him into the will of his enemies.
3. Yahweh sustains him on his sick bed. In his illness, you ⌞restore to health⌟.
4. As for me, I said, “O Yahweh, be gracious to me. Heal me, for I have sinned against you.”
5. My enemies speak evil about me, “When will he die and his name perish?”
6. And when one comes to see me, he speaks falsely; his heart gathers disaster for itself. He goes out to the street; he speaks.
7. All who hate me speak together against me. Against me they assume the ⌞worst⌟ for me:
8. “A ruinous thing is poured out on him, and now that he lies down, he will not rise up again.”
9. Even ⌞my close friend⌟, whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me.
10. But you, O Yahweh, be gracious to me and raise me up that I may repay them.
11. By this I know that you delight in me: because my enemy has not shouted in triumph over me.
12. As for me, you have upheld me in my integrity, and you have set me in your presence forever.
13. Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
