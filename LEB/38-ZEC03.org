1. And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing ⌞before⌟ the angel of Yahweh; and Satan was standing on his right to accuse him.
2. But Yahweh said to Satan, “Yahweh rebukes you, O Satan! Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebukes you! Is this not a stick snatched from the fire?”
3. And Joshua was clothed in filthy garments and was standing ⌞before⌟ the angel.
4. And he answered and said to the ones standing ⌞before⌟ him, saying, “Remove the filthy garments from him.” And he said to him, “See, I have taken away your guilt from you, and will clothe you with rich garments.”
5. And I said, “Let them put a clean headband on his head.” And they put a clean headband on his head, and they clothed him with garments. And the angel of Yahweh was standing by.
6. And the angel of Yahweh assured Joshua, saying,
7. “Thus says Yahweh of hosts: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my requirements, then you will judge my house, and you will also guard my courtyards, and I will give to you passageways among these that are standing here.
8. Listen, please, O Joshua the high priest, you and your companions that are sitting ⌞before⌟ you. For the men are a sign that, look, I am going to bring my servant the Branch.
9. For consider, the stone that ⌞I set before⌟ Joshua, on one stone are seven eyes. Look, ⌞I am going to engrave an inscription on it⌟,’ ⌞declares⌟ Yahweh of hosts, ‘and I will remove the guilt of that land in a single day.
10. On that day,’ ⌞declares⌟ Yahweh of hosts, ‘you will invite ⌞one another⌟ under the vine and under the fig tree.’ ”
