1. Shout joyfully to God, all the earth.
2. Sing the glory of his name. ⌞Set forth his glorious praise⌟.
3. Say to God, “How awesome are your works! Because of the greatness of your strength, your enemies will cringe before you.
4. All the earth will bow in worship to you, and sing praise to you. They will sing the praise of your name.” Selah
5. Come and ⌞consider⌟ the works of God; he is awesome in his dealings with the children of humankind.
6. He turned the sea into dry ground; they passed through the river on foot. There we rejoiced in him.
7. He rules by his might forever; his eyes keep watch on the nations. Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah
8. Bless our God, O peoples, and cause the sound of his praise to be heard,
9. the one who has kept our soul among the living, and has not allowed our foot to slip.
10. For you have tested us, O God; you have tried us as silver is tried.
11. You brought us into the net; you placed a ⌞heavy burden⌟ on our backs.
12. You let men ride over our heads. We went through fire and through water, but you have brought us out to the place of abundance.
13. I will come into your house with burnt offerings. I will pay to you my vows
14. that my lips uttered, and my mouth spoke in my distress.
15. Burnt offerings of fat animals I will offer to you, with the smoke of rams. I will do cattle with rams. Selah
16. Come and hear, all you God-fearers, and I will tell what he has done for me.
17. I called to him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
18. If I had considered evil in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.
19. However, God has listened; he has attended to the sound of my prayer.
20. Blessed be God, who has not turned aside my prayer, or his loyal love from me.
